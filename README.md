The data for this comeptition comes from the Taarifa waterpoints dashboard, which aggregates data from the Tanzania Ministry of Water.

  In their own words:

Taarifa is an open source platform for the crowd sourced reporting and triaging of infrastructure related issues. Think of it as a bug tracker for the real world which helps to engage citizens with their local government. We are currently working on an Innovation Project in Tanzania, with various partners.
